"""
Lists are an essential data structure in Python, allowing the coder
to reference multiple values with a single variable name.

Lists are _heterogeneous_, _ordered_, and _mutable_:
	- Heterogeneous structures can contain multiple different 
	  data types (both elemental types such as ints, float, strings,
	  and structured data types such as other lists)
	- In an ordered data structure, the sequence of values within
	  the structure is fixed
	- Values stored in a mutable data structure may be changed at
	  any time.

print('---------------------------------------')

# Declare an empty list using list()
empty = list()

# Add some elements to the empty list using append(), which places each new
# value at the end of the list:
empty.append('foo')   # first element
empty.append('bar')
empty.append('123')
empty.append(123)
empty.append(32.86)
empty.append(3<1)     # last element
print(empty)

# Declare a list by directly assigning values
fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'blueberry', 'lemon', 'peach', 'lime']

# Print the list and it's length using len()
print(f'Fruits: {fruits}')

# Lists are heterogeneous:
stuff = ['string', 3.1415, 10, 2+4j, ['list', 'in', 'list']]

print('Indexing and Slicing Lists')
print('---------------------------------------')

# Indexing lists is the same as with strings, recalling that
# the first element has an index value of 0, and that we can
# index backwards from the end of the list using negative values
fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'blueberry', 'lemon', 'peach', 'lime']
print(fruits[0])      # banana
print(fruits[1])      # orange
print(fruits[-1])     # lime
print(fruits[-2])     # peach

# Slicing is also the same as with strings, recalling that
# the slicing indices have the format [start : end+1], and that
# we can omit the start or end values if desired
print(fruits[0:2])
print(fruits[:2])
print(fruits[3:5])
print(fruits[3:])
print(fruits[-4:])

# Slicing with steps
print(fruits[1:6:2])

# Becauase lists are mutable (and strings are not) we can direclty
# modify indexed values

# The _in_ keyword can be used to check if a value is present 
# in a sequence (list, string, and others we will learn about).
# The syntax "value in list" returns True if the value is in
# the list, otherwise False.

print('Copying Lists')
print('---------------------------------------')

# Copy a list using the assignment operator
x = [5, 8, 13, 4, 9]
y = x
print(x)
print(y)

# ok, it looks like we have made a copy. Now change a value in
# one list, and display both lists again
y[0] = -1
print(x)
print(y)
id(x) == id(y)        # shallow copy (same memory address)

# Uh oh...what happened? Changing one list also changed the other.
# This is because the assignment y = x simply makes both x and y
# point to the same location in memory where the original list was
# stored. As a result, changing a value in either list modifies
# the same memory location. This is called a "shallow copy".
#
# To prevent a shallow copy, use the copy() method
x = [5, 8, 13, 4, 9]
y = x.copy()
y[0] = -1
print(x)
print(y)
id(x) == id(y)        # deep copy (different memory address)

# Warning: if the list contains another list as an element, copy() 
# will yield a shallow copy of the internal list!  To avoid this,
# there is another function called deepcopy() that is part of the
# _copy_ module, which must be manually imported into the code.
# We will not cover the use of deepcopy() in ENME202, but be aware
# of this issue for the future.

print('Other List Methods')
print('---------------------------------------')

# We have already seen how the append() and copy() methods work.
# Here let's consider some other useful list methods.

# insert(idx, val)
# Insert a single value into the list at index = idx
fruits.insert(2, 'apple')
print(fruits) 

# You might want to insert multiple values into the list using the
# following syntax, but this will instead insert a single element 
# given by the 2-element list
fruits.insert(3, ['guava', 'fig'])
print(fruits)

# remove(val)
# Remove the first occurance of val from the list
fruits.remove('banana')
print(fruits)

# pop(idx=0)
# Remove a single value at index idx, and return the value (if no
# argument is given the index defaults to 0)
x = fruits.pop()
print(x)
print(fruits)
y = fruits.pop(2)
print(y)
print(fruits)

# clear()
# Remove all elements from a list, yielding an empty list
fruits.clear()     
print(fruits)       # []

# del index[slice]
# Delete one or more elements from a list
fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'blueberry', 'lemon', 'peach', 'lime']
del fruits[0]     
print(fruits)

del fruits[1:3]     # remove elements at index 1 and 2
print(fruits)

del fruits          # remove entire list from memory and delete the list name

# extend(newlist)
# Add newlist to the end of list (nothing is returned)
even = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
odd =  [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
even.extend(odd)

# we can also join lists using the addition operator, just as we did
# with strings, returing a new list
neg = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
vals = odd + neg
print(vals)

# count(val)
# Count the number of occurences of val in list
print(even.count(6))   
print(fruits.count('grape'))

# index(val)
# Return the first index of list element with value equal to val
print(even.index(2))
print(fruits.index('orange'))

# reverse()
# Reverse the order of the list sequence (nothing is returned)
print(fruits)  
fruits.reverse()
print(fruits)  

# sort(reverse=False, key_function)
# Sort the list in ascending order based on the numerical value (numbers)
# or length (strings) of the elements. The order can be changed to
# descending by passing True as a first argument. The sort rule can
# be defined by the user by passing a sorting function as a second
# argument (we will cover functions shortly). Nothing is returned.
print(fruits)
fruits.sort()

# Note that there is also a sorted() function available that will return a 
# sorted list without modifying the original list.

print('PRACTICE PROBLEMS')
print('---------------------------------------')

practice = """

Easy
1. Access Elements: Given the list numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], write code to print the first element and the last element.
2. List Length: Write a program to determine and print the length of the list colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow"].
3. Modify an Element: Change the second element of the list fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] to "orange".
4. Concatenate Lists: Combine list1 = [1, 2, 3] and list2 = [4, 5, 6].

Medium
5. Slicing: Given the list letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], extract ["b", "c", "d"] as a new list.
6. Check Membership: Write a program to check if the number 5 is in the list numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
7. Append Element: Add the string "grape" to the list fruits = ["apple", "banana"] and print the updated list.
8. Remove Element: Remove the element "banana" from the list fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].
9. Index of Element: Find the index of "blue" in the list colors = ["red", "blue", "green"].

Hard
10. Nested List Access: Given the list matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], print the element 4.
11. List Copy: Create a copy of the list original = [10, 20, 30].
12. Replace Sublist: Replace the sublist ["b", "c"] in the list letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"] with ["x", "y", "z"].
13. List of Strings: Create a list of strings representing the days of the week (["Monday", "Tuesday", ...]).
14. Reverse a List: Reverse the list numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] using slicing and print the reversed list.
15. Find Maximum: Use the max() function to find and print the largest number in the list numbers = [10, 50, 20, 40].
