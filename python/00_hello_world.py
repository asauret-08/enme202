# The print() statement takes one of more _arguments_ separated
# by commas, and displays the argument values to the screen.
# If more than one argument is given, the values are displayed
# with a space between each argument:

print("hello world")

print("hello", "world")

# Indentation matters!  The following line will "throw an error"
# (if uncommented) because it is indented with 4 spaces instead
# of beling aligned with the left side of the text file:

#    print("fail")
