print('---------------------------------------')

# A Python module is similar to a C/C++ _library_.  Modules are Python
# code files that can be imported into other codes, giving access to
# objects (variables, functions, etc.) defined in the module. 

# Here is a short list of important built-in Python modules:
#
#     math        Mathematical functions and constants
#     os          Interacting with the operating system
#     sys         Accessing system-specific parameters and functions
#     random      Generating random numbers and sequences
#     datetime    Working with dates and times
#     json        Encoding and decoding JSON data
#     csv         Reading and writing CSV files
#     string      High-level string manipulation

# As engineers, you should also be familiar with several foundational
# open-source third-party modules for data manipulation and visualization:
#
#     numpy       Array/matrix processing, AI/ML development
#     scipy       Extension to numpy, data visualization
#     matplotlib  Data visualization and plotting
#     pandas      Data analysis using DataFrame objects

# Modules are imported using the _import_ keyword.  We will learn about 
# several built-in modules, but for now let's focus on the math module:

import math

# _import_ statements can happen anywhere in our code, but they are most commonly
# placed at the top of the code to make it easy to see which modules
# the code is dependnt on. Once a module has been imported, we can access
# objects defined in the module.  For example:

print(math.pi)          # pi = 3.1415...
print(math.e)           # Euler's number, e = 2.7182...
print(math.sqrt(2))     # square root
print(math.pow(2, 3))   # same as 2**3
print(math.floor(9.81)) # round down to nearest integer (clip after radix)
print(math.ceil(9.81))  # round up to nearest integer
print(math.log(math.e)) # ln (log base e)
print(math.log10(100))  # log base 10

# If we don't want to prepend the module name ahead of each imported object,
# objects can be imported individually using the _from_ keyword, brining the
# object names into the main namespace:

from math import pi, e     # import multiple objects on a single line
print(pi)
print(e)

# The name of an imported module can be changed using the _as_ keyword:
import math as m
print(m.sqrt(9))

# Imported object names within the main namespace can be also changed using
# the _as_ keyword:

from math import log as ln
print(ln(e**8))

print('Custom Modules:')
print('---------------------------------------')

# Any python code file we write can be imported into another file as a
# custom module.  When a module is imported, all code in the file is automatically
# executed as if the code was run from the command line (or the IDE run button).
# Custom modules are imported by the corresponding file name, ommitting the
# '.py' extension.  For example, if we have a module 'mymodule.py', it is
# imported as 'import mymodule'.

# Note that module names cannot start with a number (like this file!). There
# is a way around this using the __module__() function as in the following
# example:
#   newmod = __module__('123newmod')
# You are not responsible for this detail in ENME202.

# Often we have code that should have a set of actions when run from the
# command line that are +not+ executed when being imported as a module.
# Code execution only on direct execution can be controlled is the
# __name__ variable.  __name__ is a built-in variable that evaluates to 
# "__main__"  if the current module is executed directly (rather than being 
# imported).  Here is an example:

def run():
  print("run function executed")

if __name__ == '__main__':
  run()
else:
  print("module imported")

print('_config_ Module for Global Variables:')
print('---------------------------------------')

# Global variables defined within a given module retain global scope when
# importing the module into other code.  Sometimes we have globals defined
# in multiple modules that need to be accessible across all of these modules.
# One solution is to cross-import the modules, i.e. module A can import module B,
# and visa versa.  However, this can lead to unexpected behaviors and should
# be avoided!

# The canonical solution for sharing globals across multiple modules is to create
# a special module named config.py that contains *all* globals.  The config 
# module can then be imported into all other modules that need access to the
# global variables
