# Basic for loop syntax:

for loop_variable in iterable: 
    # Do something.
    # Never modify the iterable within the loop!

# An iterable is a data structure that can be “iterated over”. Many Python data
# structures including strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries are iterables. 

# Let's start constructing for loops with lists as the iterable data structure.
# When used with the _in_ keyword, Python will iterate through each element
# of the list, sequentially assigning eachlist value to the loop variable for each
# pass through the list.

my_string = 'among these barren crags'
for letter in my_string:
	print(letter, end=',')

my_list = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
for item in my_list:
    print(item, len(x))

# Any iterable can be used to assign values to the loop variable. Here is an
# example using a dictionary:

my_dict = {'thing 1':'left', 'thing 2': 'right'}

for item in my_dict:
	print(item)

for key in my_dict.keys():
	print(my_dict[key])


print()
print('The range() Function:')
print('---------------------------------------')

# Often we need a for loop to execute a certain number of times, with a numerical 
# loop variable that increments each time through the loop. We could do this by
# creating a list with the desired values, for example:

for i in [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]:
	print(f'{i}^2 = {i**2}')

# What if the loop variable needs to go to 100?  1e3?  1e6?  This manual approach
# quickly becomes impractical. Instead, we can use the range() function to
# generate an iterable data structure with the desired values on the fly
#
# The range() function returns an iterable of integers, by default starting at 0,
# using the following syntax options:
#
# range(end+1)
# range(start, end+1)
# range(start, end+1, step)

for i in range(10):
	print(f'{i}^2 = {i**2}')

for idx in range(0,6):
	print(idx)

for x in range(2, 15, 3):
    print(x)

# Sometimes we want a loop to execute a certain number of times, 
# but we don't need to access the loop variable value itself.
# In this case, use a single underscore (_) to denote a
# "throwaway" variable:

for _ in range(10):
    print('.', end='')


print()
print('Nested for Loops:')
print('---------------------------------------')

# When a for loop is placed inside another for loop, the inner loop executes
# completely for each iteration of the outer loop. Nested for loops are
# typically used to iterate over multi-dimensional data structures or
# when multiple levels of iteration are needed. 

# Example -- use nested for loops to display the list structure for the
# variable _matrix_ as a 2D array:

matrix = [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9] ]
for row in range(3):
    for col in range(3):
        print(matrix[row][col], end=' ')
    print()


print()
print('break, continue, else Statements:')
print('---------------------------------------')

# The break statement will stop the current loop, and continue code execution

# The continue statement will end the current loop iteration, but continue
# the loop with the next value of the loop variable

for x in range(2,6):        # outer loop, x=2,3,4,5
    for y in range(1,6):    # nested loop, y=1,2,3,4,5
        if x == y:
            continue  # go directly to next y value
        # keep going if 'continue' not called...
        print(f'{x}, {y}')
        if x + y > 5:
            break  # exit inner loop, go to next x value
    print('.')


# The else statement after a for loop defines a block of code that will
# execute when the loop ends _without_ a break statement occurring. Try
# the following with limit = 10 and limit = 5

limit = 9
for val in [1,3,6,8]:
    print(val)
    if val > limit:
        break
else:
    print('done')    # only runs when the break statement is avoided


print()
print('Pass Statememt:')
print('---------------------------------------')

# The pass statement is "syntactic filler" -- it creates a line of code when a statement
# is required, but does not do anything. It is used to avoid errors, such as in for loops
# that do not have any functional lines of code, and as a placeholder for future
# code expansion.

for val in range(100):
    pass


print()
print('Other Iterables as Loop Indices:')
print('---------------------------------------')

# Remember again that any iterable can be used to assign values to the loop variable. 
# Here is an example using tuples:

knights = {
  'gallahad': 'the pure', 
  'robin': 'the brave' }

for item in knights.items():          # items() returns an iterable of tuples
  print(f'{item[0]}, {item[1]}') 

for (a, b) in knights.items():        # same idea but unpack the tuple
  print(a, b)


print()
print('Looping with Index Values -- enumerate():')
print('---------------------------------------')

# Consider a loop where we want to print the index value for each element 
# of a list that is greater than 5.  We might start by writing the following
# loop:

vals = [4, -2, 98, 2.5, 6.02]
for v in vals:
  if v > 5:
    print('uh oh')     # What do we do??  There is no loop variable to print!

# To access the index values, use the enumerate() function
#
# enumerate(iter) returns an iterator of tuples, with each tuple containing
# an (index, value) pair:

for (idx, v) in enumerate(vals):
  if v > 5:
    print(idx)


print()
print('Looping Through Paired Lists Using zip():')
print('---------------------------------------')

# zip() takes 2 or more iterables of equal length as arguments, and generates
# a new iterable of tuples, with each tuple containing corresponding values 
# from each of the input iterables:

letters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']                    
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
combined = []

for letter, number in zip(letters, numbers):
    combined.append({'letter':letter, 'number':number})

print(combined)
print(combined['C'])


# Another zip() example with more than 2 iterables:

vec1 = [2,4,7]
vec2 = [0,1,0]
vec3 = [1,5,9]

for (v1,v2,v3) in zip(vec1, vec2, vec3):
    print(v1 + v2 + v3)


print()
print('while Loops:')
print('---------------------------------------')

# _While_ loops are necessary when the number of loop iterations is
# not know ahead of time, but rather is defined by a condition that changes
# within the loop:

a = -10
while a <= 10:
    print(a)
    a += 1

# Infinite loops will continue indefinitely (until hitting a break statement):

while True:
    if int(input('enter number > 10 to end: ')) > 10:
        break

PRACTICE PROBLEMS

1. Use a for loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 20.
2. Use a while loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 20.
3. Use a for loop to print each character of the string "ENME202" on a new line.
4. Use a while loop to print a countdown from 10 to 1.
5. Use a for loop to calculate the factorial of 12, without using math.factorial().
6. Use a while loop to print all positive integers whose factorial is less than 1000
   (ok to use math.factorial() for this problem).
7. Use a for loop to print the list ['a','b','c',1,2,3] in reverse order (do not
   using the list reverse() method or list slicing to perform the inversion).
8. Use a while loop to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number 
   (e.g. given 123 the result is 1+2+3 = 6).
9. Use nested for loops to print all prime numbers between 1 and 100.
10. Use a for loop to find the first 5 terms of the Taylor series expansion for 
    cos(x), and use the result to estimate cos(pi/4).
11. Repeat the previous problem using a while loop to continue taking Taylor series
    terms until the different between successive terms is less than 1e-6.
12. Use nested for loops to print N lines of the following pattern:
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    Demonstrate this for 10 lines. You _must_ use nested for loops (hint: consider
    using the loop variable in the outer loop when defining the inner loop's iterable).
13. Use nested for loops to generate a multiplication table (1 to 10) in grid format. 
    Use string formatting to align the table elements appropriately.
14. A sensor is used to measure a voltage every 0.5 s, with measured voltage values 
    stored in the following Python list:
        v = [2.41, 2.22, 2.53, 0, 3.14, 2.98, 1.66, 2.43]
    Use a for loop and the enumerate() function to display the measurement time and 
    voltage for all readings with the following example format:
        t = 0: V = 2.41
        t = 0.5: V = 2.22
        etc. 
15. A different sensor system records voltage values at random time points, and stores
    the time and voltage values in separate lists:
        t = [0.6, 1.7, 4.6, 12.2, 15.0, 31.9, 33.2, 52.6]
        v = [2.41, 2.22, 2.53, 0, 3.14, 2.98, 1.66, 2.43]
    Use a for loop and the zip() function to display these values in the same format
    as the previous problem.
16. Use a for loop and the enumerate() function to calculate the following expression:
         N
         Σ (2^i * p(i))
        i=0
    where p = [1,2,3,...] is the list of positive integers. You _must_ use enumerate()
    to generate values of i in this problem (even though there are easier ways to 
    solve this).
