%  FLOW CONTROL: 
%  FOR and WHILE LOOPS
%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% FOR LOOPS
%

% The "for" loop repeats a set of commands a specified number of times.

% Here's a simple loop to repeat an action a specified number of times
% in this case, the loop repeats 5 times, and simply displays "Hello world"
% on the screen using the disp() function.

for k = [1,2,3,4,5]
	disp('Hello world'); 
end

% The variable k is called the "loop variable".
% Given "for k = a:b", the k is initialized to a, and the loop
% is executed.  When the loop code is completed, the loop variable
% is incremented to k = a+1 and the loop code is executed again.  
% This process repeats until k > b.

% Thus "for k = 1:10" starts k at 1.  Each time through the loop the 
% value of k is increased by 1, until k gets larger than 10.
%
% You can see this explicitly by having the loop show the value of k:

for k = 1:3
  disp(k) 
end


% You'll notice that the defined range for k after the "for" keyword
% looks like array colon notation, and it is.  Thus we can define
% the loop variable range as an array with non-unity steps:

for k = 2:-.5:0
  disp(k) 
end

% In fact, the loop variable values can be defined as ANY array,
% with any valid Matlab values, for example:

for k = [4 0 1 99 pi 2+3i]
  disp(k) 
end

% or:

a = [4 0 1 99 pi 2+3i];
for k = a
  disp(k) 
end

% Here Matlab simply iterates through each value in the array a, from
% a(1) to a(end)

% Since we know that the loop variable k is changing as the loop runs,
% in a predictable fashion, we can use it in calculations as needed.  For
% example, the loop below displays the powers of 2 from 1 to 10:

for k = 1:10
  disp(2^k) 
end

% Here is another loop that repeatedly adds 1 to variable foo 
% (which has its initial value set to 0) and re-assigns the result
% back to foo:

foo = 0;
for k = 1:10
  foo = foo + 1; 
end
disp(foo)

% Sum first N inverse powers of 2: 2^0 + 2^(-1) + 2^(-2) + ... :

s = 0; N=5;
for k = 0:N
  s = s + 2^(-k);
  disp(s)
end

% We can also use the loop index variable as an array index
% within the loop.  For example, let's implement the equivalent of 
% Matlab's polyval() function manually, by evaluating a 2nd order
% polynomial defined by p (assuming standard Matlab order) at each of
% the points in array x, returning the results to a new array f.  
% Also, add up all the f(k) values as part of the same loop:

clear
p = [1 -2 3];   % polynomial coefficients
x = -3:.02:1;   % independent variable values
s = 0;          % summation variable for use in loop
for k = 1:length(x)   % loop through each value of x
    f(k) = p(1)*x(k)^2 + p(2)*x(k) + p(3);   % evaluate p(x_k)
    s = s + f(k);                            % add result to cumulative sum
end

length(x)   % ans = 201
length(f)   % ans = 201
s           % --> 1476.7
sum(f)      % ans = 1476.7


% NESTED LOOPS

% We can "nest" loops, i.e. put a loop, within a loop, within a loop, etc...
% Consider an example where we want to display each element in a
% matrix, row by row:

A = [ 1 2 3
      6 5 4
      0 0 9 ];

for i=1:3
  for j=1:3
    disp(A(i,j))
  end
end


% As another example, consider the polynomial earlier problem, where
% p was required to be a 3-element array (2nd order
% polynomial).  Let's go one step further by modifying the code to
% work with an arbitrary length array:

clear
p = [1 2 3 -4 0];   % 4th order polynomial
x = -3:.02:1;       % independent variable values
for i = 1:length(x) % loop through each value of x
    %f(i) = 0;       % initialize result (can you see why this is needed?)
    r = length(p)   % polynomial order
    for j = 1:r     % evaluate each polynomial term, and sum the results
        f(i) = f(i) + p(j)*x(i)^(r-j);
    end
end



% Here are some additional loop examples, set up as functions.

%%%%%%%%%%% mysin.m %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

function s = mysin(x)   
  % Compute 3 term approximation to sin(x), without loop
  s = x - x^3/6 + x^5/120;
end


%%%%%%%%%%% mysin2.m %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

function s = mysin2(x)
  % Compute a 3 term approx to sin(x) using a loop
  s = 0;
  for k=0:2
    s = s + ((-1)^k)*x^(2*k+1)/factorial(2*k+1);
  end
end


%%%%%%%%%%% mysinN.m %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

function s = mysinN(x,N)
  % Compute an N-term approx to sin(x) using a loop,
  % with N passed as an argument to the function
  s = 0;
  for k=0:N-1 
    s = s + ((-1)^k) * x^(2*k+1) / factorial(2*k+1);
  end
end

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% Exercise:
% Write a loop that calculates a 6-term sin() approximation
% over the range of x = 0 --> 2*pi, and plot the result together with
% the true sin curve for comparison.  Hint: you need an integer for the
% index into the array holding your result.  Think about this before
% we look at the solution below...


% ...



clear
figure(1); clf

n = 100;          % # of values to calculate over 0->2pi range
step = 2*pi/n;    % step size
for i = 1:n+1       % loop over the number of values 
    x = (i-1)*step;   % determine x for each index
    sin_approx(i) = mysinN(x,6);  % custom function to approximate sin(x)
    sin_true(i) = sin(x);         % find Matlab's "true" sin(x) value
end
plot(sin_approx)
hold on
plot(sin_true)


% In the above plots, the x-axis is just the index value of the
% sin arrays. How can we modify the code to include the actual
% x-axis values?

% Think about it....


% ...



clear
figure(1); clf

n = 100;          
step = 2*pi/n;
x = 0 : step : 2*pi;          % (1) set up array of x-axis values, or
for i = 1:n+1       
    % x(i) = (i-1)*step;             % (2) define x in loop as alternate to (1)
    sin_approx(i) = mysinN(x(i),6);  % note use of x(i) here...
    sin_true(i) = sin(x(i));         % ...and here
end
plot(x,sin_approx)                   % plot with x array
hold on
plot(x,sin_true)


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% WHILE LOOPS
%

% Unlike the for() loop, which runs through the loop a fixed
% number of times before stopping, the while() loop executes
% continuously as long as the loop argument is true.

a = 0;
while a < 10    % stay in loop as long as "a < 10" is true
  a = a + 1;
  disp(a)
end

2*a

% While() loops can also be used to create a program that never
% ends (an infinite loop):

while 1             % 1 = true (0 = false)
  % do something
  % ctrl-c to stop the program
end


% while() loops are required when the condition for stopping the loop 
% changes within the loop itself.  Thus while() loops can do
% things that for() loops cannot, since for() loops require that
% the start and end points of the loop are pre-defined
% when the loop is first entered.
%
% On the other hand, any for() loop can be re-written as a while()
% loop, for example:

a = [-2.5 5.0 54.1 22];
for k = 1:length(a)       % the index k increments automatically
  disp(a(k))
end

% equivalent while() loop:

a = [-2.5 5.0 54.1 22];
k = 1;
while k <= length(a)
  disp(a(k))
  k = k+1;    % increment the index k manually
end


% Note that in the above while() loops we use comparisons
% like "<" and "<=".  These are logical comparisons that
% yields a result that is either true (1) or false (0).  We will
% talk more about logical comparisons in the next lecture topic.

% Again: a while() loop should be used when the number of times the
% loop needs to be executed is dependent on what is happening
% inside the loop, and a for() loop should be used when the
% number of times to execute the loop is known before the
% loop is started.

% For example, here is another version of our mysin() function
% that uses a while() loop to keep evaluating terms in the 
% power series until the newest term is below a defined tolerance
% limit (compared to our previous version, where the number of
% iterations was defined before starting the loop):

function s = mySin5(x)
  s = 0;
  kterm = x;
  k = 0;
  tol = 1e-12;  % tolerance

  % Keep adding terms in the series until the size
  % of the current term is <= mytol (or equivalently:
  % WHILE the size of kterm is GREATER than tol):

  while (abs(kterm) > tol)
    kterm = ((-1)^k)*x^(2*k+1)/factorial(2*k+1);
    s = s + kterm;
    k = k + 1;    % Must now increment k ourselves at each cycle!
  end
end


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Break
%

% A "for" or "while" loop can be exited at any time using "break".
% This will become very useful later when we can combine break
% with conditionals ("if" statements) so that a loop can
% be stopped when some particular condition is met (separate from
% the loop conditions, that is).

for i=1:10
  disp(i)
  break
end

% This loop will only execute a single time, since the break statement
% is reached during the first time through the loop

% By the way, all of Matlab's array arithmetic tricks can be done 
% using loops.  However, Matlab's array arithmetic is implemented
% (using loops!) VERY efficiently using "vectoralized" code, 
% that is MUCH faster than our loops when working with large arrays.  
% 
% Loops have much more general uses, though, as some of the current (and 
% future) examples show, and programming languages like C++ which don't 
% have Matlab's array arithmetic features will REQUIRE loops when working 
% with arrays.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Example combining for() and while()
%
% ODE solver â€“ Euler method
% (finite difference approximation)
% 
% Approximate any derivitive terms in the ODE using discrete
% time steps dt, so that:
%    t(i) = t(i-1) + dt
% and:
%    y' = (y(i) - y(i-1)) / dt
% Solve the ODE for y(i) at "sufficiently small" time
% steps to get the solution.  What is small enough?
% One approach is to guess a starting value for dt,
% and solve for y using this value.  Then, cut dt in half
% and try again -- if the new solution for y changes more
% than some critical value, then keep dividing dt by 2 until
% the solution is below this critical value.

% Example ODE: y'(t) = 1 - y,  y(0)=y0
%
% Convert to discrete time:
%    (y(i) - y(i-1)) / dt = 1 - y(i-1)
%
% Solve for y(i):
%    y(i) = y(i-1) + dt*(1- y(i-1))  <-- implement this eqn in loop

clear all

y0 = 0.0 ;   % initial value of y
dt = 1.5 ;   % initial time step
y = [y0] ;   % initial condition for y(t)
t_max = 10;  % max time to run the solver until

% Keep track of the area under the curve (this is just one option,
% others are possible):
area = 100;   % start big to force at least one iteration

% Set the allowable area delta between iterations:
delta_limit = 0.001;

% Initialize the current delta to something larger than the allowable
% limit (to force entry into the while loop below):
delta = delta_limit + 1;

figure(1); clf; hold on   %  Get ready for plotting

while delta > delta_limit
    t = 0:dt:t_max ; % define the time series

    %  Step forward in time, one step at a time
    for (i = 1:length(t))
      y(i+1) = y(i) + dt*( 1 - y(i) ) ;  % calculate y at each time point
    end
    area_old = area;
    area = sum(y)/length(y);
    delta = abs(area - area_old)
    dt = dt / 2;
    plot(t, y(1:end-1), 'b-o', 'linewidth', 2)
    set(gca,'fontsize', 18)      % change the plot font size
    xlabel('t'); ylabel('y(t)')
    pause  
          
end

% Finally, plot the analytic solution (which we have for this
% simple linear ODE):
y_exact = 1 + (y0-1)*exp(-t) ;   % analytical solution
plot(t,y_exact(1:i),'g','linewidth',4)
